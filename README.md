Simple Calculator
- It is a simple version of calculator where the user will input numbers, operation, and the program will print the result.

Process:
1. Show the operations that is available on mini calculator and the key that the user will press on corresponding operation.
2. Add a try catch to ensure that if their inputs are wrong, the user will be notified.
3. Ask the user to enter two numbers
4. Ask the user to enter the math operation that they want to use:
                      Addition = 1
                      Subtraction = 2
                      Multiplication = 3
                      Division = 4
5. If the user chooses addition, get the sum by adding the first and second numbers and print the result.
6. Same in subtraction. If the user chooses it, subtract the first number to second number and print its result.
7. If the user chooses multiplication, just get the product of two numbers and print the result.
8. And if the user chooses division, get the quotient by dividing the first number to second number and print the result.
9. I added a try catch in division in case the user used zero as divisor.
10. After solving, ask the user if they want to continue on solving or not.
11. If the user entered Y or yes, the process will repeat to step 1
12. If the user entered N or no, it will display "THANK YOU FOR USING THE SIMPLE CALCULATOR!", and the program will stop
13. In case that the user entered answer that is not on the choices, they will be asked again.
